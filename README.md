JavaScript project developed by me ([Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/)) at the end of Unit 4 ([Principles of Web Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/1_fundamentos-do-desv-web)) of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com)'s Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to solve programming logic challenges by using functions.
